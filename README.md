Legally questionable userscripts I wrote.

## YarrPlay
Script that adds movie embeds from [vidsrc.me](https://vidsrc.me) onto IMDb pages seamlessly.

I highly recommend you have something like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) installed if you're gonna use this.

### [Install](https://github.com/tacohitbox/lqus/raw/main/yarrplay.user.js)

## VidSrc Improver
 
Script that removes videos that are unplayable from [vidsrc.me](https://vidsrc.me).

Still recommended to have [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) installed.
