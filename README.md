# userscripts
Some userscripts I wrote. Some of these are legally questionable, others are just useful to the average user.

Don't use these for illegal things *or do, I guess I can't stop you*.

## YarrPlay
Script that adds movie embeds from [vidsrc.me](https://vidsrc.me) onto IMDb pages seamlessly.

I highly recommend you have something like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) installed if you're gonna use this.

## VidSrc Improver
 
Script that removes videos that are unplayable from [vidsrc.me](https://vidsrc.me).

Still recommended to have [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) installed.

## Napalm FTP "Error Showing Ads" Bypass

Script that shows links even with an adblocker installed on [searchftps.net](https://www.searchftps.net)

### Screenshots

Before you add the userscript:

After you add it:
